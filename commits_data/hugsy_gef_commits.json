      "message": "Fix crash on Old GDB warning\n\nOn a system with gdb 7.6 and python 2.7, I get this nice traceback trying to install Gef:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"~/.gdbinit-gef.py\", line 9473, in <module>\r\nTypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it's because `str.join('.', (7,7) )` doesn't work -- it needs the ints stringified. The fix is trivial, see diff.\r\n\r\nIn such a good project, having implemented the version check, you certainly don't want it to crash!",
